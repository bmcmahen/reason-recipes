They sort *lexicographically* (so the timestamp is converted to characters\n *    that will sort properly).\n * 4. They're monotonically increasing.

We do\n *    this by using the previous random bits but \"incrementing\" them by 1 (only\n *    in the case of a timestamp collision).\n */\nexports.nextPushId = (function () {\n    // Modeled after base64 web-safe chars, but ordered by ASCII.\n    var PUSH_CHARS = '-0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';\n    // Timestamp of last push, used to prevent local collisions if you push twice\n    // in one ms.\n    var lastPushTime = 0;\n    // We generate 72-bits of randomness which get turned into 12 characters and\n    // appended to the timestamp to prevent collisions with other clients.
